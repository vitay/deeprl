# Overview {.unnumbered}

The goal of this document is to keep track the state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning. It starts with basics in reinforcement learning and deep learning to introduce the notations and covers different classes of deep RL methods, value-based or policy-based, model-free or model-based, etc.

Different classes of deep RL methods can be identified. This document will focus on the following ones:   

1. Value-based algorithms (DQN...) used mostly for discrete problems like video games.
2. Policy-gradient algorithms (A3C, DDPG...) used for continuous control problems such as robotics.
3. Recurrent attention models (RAM...) for partially observable problems.
4. Model-based RL to reduce the sample complexity by incorporating a model of the environment.
5. Application of deep RL to robotics

One could extend the list and talk about hierarchical RL, inverse RL, imitation-based RL, etc...

See @Li2017, @Arulkumaran2017 and @Mousavi2018 for recent overviews of deep RL. 

The CS294 course of Sergey Levine at Berkeley is incredibly complete: <http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/>. The Reinforcement Learning course by David Silver at UCL covers also the whole field: <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html>.

This series of posts from Arthur Juliani <https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0> also provide a very good introduction to deep RL, associated to code samples using tensorflow.


**Notes**

This document is meant to stay *work in progress* forever, as new algorithms will be added as they are published. Feel free to comment, correct, suggest, pull request by writing to <julien.vitay@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>.

For some reason, this document is better printed using chrome. Use the single file version [here](./DeepRL.html) and print it to pdf. Alternatively, a pdf version generated using LaTeX is available [here](./DeepRL.pdf) (some images may disappear, as LaTeX does not support .gif or .svg images).

The style is adapted from the Github-Markdown CSS template <https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-markdown-css>. The document is written in Pandoc's Markdown and converted to html and pdf using pandoc-citeproc and pandoc-crossref.
