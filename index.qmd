title: Preface
---

The goal of this webbook is to keep track of the state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning. It starts with basics in reinforcement learning and deep learning to introduce the notations. It then covers different classes of deep RL methods, value-based or policy-based, model-free or model-based, etc. Later sections focus on more advanced topics.

This document is meant to stay *work in progress* forever, as new algorithms will be added as they are published. Feel free to comment, correct, suggest, pull request by writing to <julien.vitay@gmail.com>.
