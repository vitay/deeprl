title: Dynamic programming

The interesting property of the Bellman equations is that, if the states have the Markov property, they admit *one and only one* solution. This means that for a given policy, if the dynamics of the MDP are known, it is possible to compute the value of all states or state-action pairs by solving the Bellman equations for all states or state-action pairs (*policy evaluation*).

Once the values are known for a given policy, it is possible to improve the policy by selecting with the highest probability the action with the highest Q-value. For example, if the current policy chooses the action $a_1$ over $a_2$ in $s$ ($\pi(s, a_1) > \pi(s, a_2)$), but after evaluating the policy it turns out that $Q^\pi(s, a_2) > Q^\pi(s, a_1)$ (the expected return after $a_2$ is higher than after $a_1$), it makes more sense to preferentially select $a_2$, as there is more reward afterwards. We can then create a new policy $\pi'$ where $\pi'(s, a_2) > \pi'(s, a_1)$, which is is *better* policy than $\pi$ as more reward can be gathered after $s$.

**Dynamic programming** (DP) alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement. If the problem is Markov, it can be shown that DP converges to the *optimal policy* $\pi^*$, i.e. the policy where the expected return is maximal in all states.

Note that by definition the optimal policy is *deterministic* and *greedy*: if there is an action with a maximal Q-value for the optimal policy, it should be systematically taken. For the optimal policy $\pi^*$, the Bellman equations become:

$$
    V^{*}(s) = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \cdot [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \cdot V^{*} (s') ]
$$

$$
    Q^{*}(s, a) = \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \cdot [r(s, a, s') + \gamma \max_{a' \in \mathcal{A}} Q^* (s', a') ]
$$

Dynamic programming can only be used when:

* the dynamics of the MDP ($p(s'|s, a)$ and $r(s, a, s')$) are fully known.
* the number of states and state-action pairs is small (one Bellman equation per state or state/action to solve).

In practice, sample-based methods such as Monte-Carlo or temporal difference are used.
