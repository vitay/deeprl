# Markov Decision Process

## Markov Decision Process

### Definition

Reinforcement Learning methods apply to problems where an agent interacts with an environment in discrete time steps (@fig-agentenv). 
At time $t$, the agent is in state $s_t$ and decides to perform an action $a_t$. At the next time step, it arrives in the state $s_{t+1}$ and obtains the reward $r_{t+1}$. In the genral case, transitions can be stochastic (there is a probability of arriving in a given state after an action), as well as the rewards (as in the bandits previously seen). The goal of the agent is to maximize the reward obtained on the long term.

These problems are formalized as **Markov Decision Processes** (MDP) and defined by six quantities $<\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, p_0, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma>$. For a finite MDP, we have:

1. The **state space** $\mathcal{S} = \{ s_i\}_{i=1}^N$, where each state respects the Markov property.

2. The **action space** $\mathcal{A} = \{ a_i\}_{i=1}^M$.

3. An **initial state distribution** $p_0(s_0)$ (from which states the agent is most likely to start).

4. The **state transition probability function**, defining the probability of arriving in the state $s'$ at time $t+1$ after being in the state $s$ and performing the action $a$ at time $t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{P}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow & P(\mathcal{S}) \\
    p(s' | s, a) & =  P (s_{t+1} = s' | s_t = s, a_t = a) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

5. The **expected reward function** defining the (stochastic) reward obtained after performing $a$ in state $s$ and arriving in $s'$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{R}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow & \Re \\
    r(s, a, s') &=  \mathbb{E} (r_{t+1} | s_t = s, a_t = a, s_{t+1} = s') \\
\end{aligned}
$$


6. The **discount factor** $\gamma \in [0, 1]$.

In deep RL, the state and action spaces can be infinite, but let's focus on finite MDPs for now.

The behavior of the agent over time is a **trajectory** (also called episode, history or roll-out) $\tau = (s_0, a_0, s_1, a_, \ldots, s_T, a_T)$ defined by the dynamics of the MDP. Each transition occurs with a probability $p(s'|s, a)$ and provides a certain amount of reward defined by $r(s, a, s')$. In episodic tasks, the horizon $T$ is finite, while in continuing tasks $T$ is infinite.

### Markov property

The state of the agent represents all the information needed to take decisions and solve the task. For a robot navigating in an environment, this may include all its sensors, its positions as tracked by a GPS, but also the relative position of all objects / persons it may interact with. For a board game, the description of the board is usually enough. 

Importantly, the **Markov property** states that:

> The future is independent of the past given the present.

In mathematical terms for a transition $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$:

$$
    p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t) = p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t, s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, \dots s_0, a_0)
$$

i.e. you do not need the full history of the agent to predict where it will arrive after an action. In simple problems, this is just a question of providing enough information to the description of a state: if a transition depends on what happened in the past, just put that information in the state description.

A state representation with the Markov property should therefore not only contain all the important information available at time $t$, but also information from the past that is necessary to take a decision.

If the Markov property is not met, RL methods may not converge (or poorly). In many problems, one does not have access to the true states of the agent, but one can only indirectly observe them. For example, in a video game, the true state is defined by a couple of variables: coordinates $(x, y)$ of the two players, position of the ball, speed, etc. However, in Atari games all you have access to are the raw pixels: sometimes the ball may be hidden behind a wall or a tree, but it still exists in the state space. Speed information is also not observable in a single frame.

In a **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process** (POMDP), observations $o_t$ come from a space $\mathcal{O}$ and are linked to underlying states using the density function $p(o_t| s_t)$. Observations are usually not Markov, so the full history of observations $h_t = (o_0, a_0, \dots o_t, a_t)$ is needed to solve the problem. We will see later how recurrent neural networks can help with POMDPs.

### Rewards and returns

As with n-armed bandits, we only care about the **expected reward** received during a transition $s \rightarrow s'$ (*on average*), but the actual reward received $r_{t+1}$ may vary around the expected value with some unknown variance. In hard RL, we only care about the expected reward and ignore its variance, as we suppose that we can take actions an infinity of times. However, distributional RL investigates the role of this variance (see Section @sec-distributionalrl).

$$r(s, a, s') =  \mathbb{E} (r_{t+1} | s_t = s, a_t = a, s_{t+1} = s')$$

![Reward distributions for several actions in a single state.](img/bandit-example.png){#fig-rewarddistribution}


An important distinction in practice is between **sparse vs. dense rewards**.  Sparse rewards take non-zero values only during certain transitions: game won/lost, goal achieved, timeout, etc. Dense rewards provide non-zero values during each transition: distance to goal, energy consumption, speed of the robot, etc. As we will see later, MDPs with sparse rewards are much harder to learn.

![Dense vs. sparse rewards. Source: <https://forns.lmu.build/classes/spring-2020/cmsi-432/lecture-13-2.html>](img/sparse-dense.png){#fig-sparserewards}


Over time, the MDP will be in a sequence of states (possibly infinite):

$$s_0 \rightarrow s_1 \rightarrow s_2  \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow s_T$$

and collect a sequence of rewards:

$$r_1 \rightarrow r_2 \rightarrow r_3  \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow r_{T}$$

![Sequence of transitions over time in a MDP.](img/rl-sequence.png){#fig-rl-sequence}

In a MDP, we are interested in maximizing the **return** $R_t$, i.e. the discounted sum of **future** rewards after the step $t$:

$$
    R_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma \, r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 \, r_{t+3} + \ldots = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k \, r_{t+k+1}
$$  

The return is sometimes called the **reward-to-go**: how much reward will I collect from now on?
Of course, you can never know the return at time $t$: transitions and rewards are probabilistic, so the received rewards in the future are not exactly predictable at $t$.
$R_t$ is therefore purely theoretical: RL is all about **estimating** the return.

More generally, for a trajectory (episode) $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_1, s_1, a_1, \ldots, s_T)$, one can define its return as:

$$ R(\tau) = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t \, r_{t+1} $$


The **discount factor** (or discount rate, or discount) $\gamma \in [0, 1]$ is a very important parameter in RL: It defines the **present value of future rewards**.
Receiving 10 euros now has a higher **value** than receiving 10 euros in ten years, although the reward is the same: you do not have to wait.
The value of receiving a reward $r$ after $k+1$ time steps is $\gamma^k \, r$, meaning that immediate rewards are better than delayed rewards.

$\gamma$ determines the relative importance of future rewards for the behavior:

* if $\gamma$ is close to 0, only the immediately available rewards will count: the agent is greedy or **myopic**.
* if $\gamma$ is close to 1, even far-distance rewards will be taken into account: the agent is **farsighted**.


Another important property is that, when $\gamma < 1$, $\gamma^k$ tends to 0 when $k$ goes to infinity: this makes sure that the return is always **finite**. We can therefore try to maximize it.

$$
    R_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma \, r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 \, r_{t+3} + \ldots = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k \, r_{t+k+1}
$$ 


![The value of $\gamma^k$ decays over time. The closer $\gamma$ is to 1, the slower the decay.](img/decayinggamma.png){#fig-decayinggamma}

For **episodic tasks** (which break naturally into finite episodes of length $T$, e.g. plays of a game, trips through a maze), the return is always finite and easy to compute at the end of the episode. The discount factor can be set to 1.

$$ 
    R_t = \sum_{k=0}^{T} r_{t+k+1}
$$

For **continuing tasks** (which can not be split into episodes), the return could become infinite if $\gamma = 1$. The discount factor has to be smaller than 1.

$$ 
    R_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k \, r_{t+k+1}
$$

## Why the reward on the long term?

![Example of a MDP with two actions in state $s_1$, lading to two different returns. The states $s_5$ and $s_6$ are terminal states, where no reward is received anymore.](img/return-example.svg){#fig-returnexample width=60%}

In the MDP above, selecting the action $a_1$ in $s_1$ does not bring reward immediately ($r_1 = 0$) but allows to reach $s_5$ in the future and get a reward of 10.
Selecting $a_2$ in $s_1$ brings immediately a reward of 1, but that will be all.

Depending on the value of $\gamma$, the optimal action might be $a_1$ or $a_2$, depending on which one brings more reward **on the long term**.

When selecting $a_1$ in $s_1$, the discounted return is:

$$
    R = 0 + \gamma \, 0 + \gamma^2 \, 0 + \gamma^3 \, 10 + \ldots = 10 \, \gamma^3
$$

while it is $R= 1$ for the action $a_2$.

For high values of $\gamma$, $10\, \gamma^3$ is higher than one, so the action $a_1$ is the optimal action. 
For small values of $\gamma$, $10\, \gamma^3$ becomes smaller than one, and the action $a_2$ becomes the optimal action. The discount rate $\gamma$ can totally change the optimal behavior of the agent, that is why it is part of the MDP definition and not just a hyperparameter. 

:::


### Policy 

The probability that an agent selects a particular action $a$ in a given state $s$ is called the **policy** $\pi$.

$$
\begin{align}
    \pi &: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow P(\mathcal{S})\\
    (s, a) &\rightarrow \pi(s, a)  = P(a_t = a | s_t = s) \\
\end{align}
$$

The policy can be **deterministic** (one action has a probability of 1, the others 0) or **stochastic**. In all cases, the sum of the probabilities in a given state must be one:

$$
    \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(s, a) = 1
$$


The goal of an agent is to find a policy that maximizes the sum of received rewards on the long term, i.e. the return $R_t$ at each each time step. This policy is called the **optimal policy** $\pi^*$. It maximizes the following objective function:

$$
    \pi^* = \text{argmax} \, \mathcal{J}(\pi) = \text{argmax} \,  \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \rho_\pi} [R(\tau)]
$$

where $\rho_\pi$ is the density distribution of the trajectories generated by the policy $\pi$.

In summary, RL is an **adaptive optimal control** method for Markov Decision Processes using (sparse) rewards as a partial feedback. At each time step $t$, the agent observes its Markov state $s_t \in \mathcal{S}$, produces an action $a_t \in \mathcal{A}(s_t)$, receives a reward according to this action $r_{t+1} \in \Re$ and updates its state: $s_{t+1} \in \mathcal{S}$.
The agent generates trajectories $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_1, s_1, a_1, \ldots, s_T)$ depending on its policy $\pi(s ,a)$.
The goal is to find the **optimal policy** $\pi^* (s, a)$ that maximizes in expectation the return of each possible trajectory under that policy.


## Value functions

A central notion in RL is to estimate the **value** (or **utility**) of every state and action of the MDP.
The **state-value** $V^{\pi} (s)$ of a state $s$ is defined as the mathematical expectation of the return when starting from that state and thereafter following the agent’s current policy $\pi$:

$$  V^{\pi} (s) = \mathbb{E}_{\rho_\pi} ( R_t | s_t = s) = \mathbb{E}_{\rho_\pi} ( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k+1} |s_t=s ) $$


The mathematical expectation operator $\mathbb{E}(\cdot)$ is indexed by $\rho_\pi$, the probability distribution of states achievable with $\pi$. Indeed, several trajectories are possible after the state $s$:

* The state transition probability function $p(s' | s, a)$ leads to different states $s'$, even if the same actions are taken.
* The expected reward function $r(s, a, s')$ provides stochastic rewards, even if the transition $(s, a, s')$ is the same.
* The policy $\pi$ itself is stochastic.

Only rewards that are obtained using the policy $\pi$ should be taken into account, not the complete distribution of states and rewards.


The value of a state is not intrinsic to the state itself, it depends on the policy: One could be in a state which is very close to the goal (only one action left to win the game), but if the policy is very bad, the "good" action will not be chosen and the state will have a small value.

The value of taking an action $a$ in a state $s$ under policy $\pi$ is the expected return starting 

Similarly, the **action-value** (or **Q-value**) for a state-action pair $(s, a)$ under the policy $\pi$  is defined as:

$$
\begin{align}
    Q^{\pi} (s, a)  & = \mathbb{E}_{\rho_\pi} ( R_t | s_t = s, a_t =a) \\
                    & = \mathbb{E}_{\rho_\pi} ( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k+1} |s_t=s, a_t=a) \\
\end{align}
$$

The Q-value of an action is sometimes called its **utility**: is it worth taking this action?

## Bellman equations

### Relationship between V and Q

The value of a state $V^{\pi}(s)$ depends on the value $Q^{\pi} (s, a)$ of the action that will be chosen by the policy $\pi$ in $s$:

$$
        V^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi(s,a)} [Q^{\pi} (s, a)] = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(s, a) \, Q^{\pi} (s, a)
$$

If the policy $\pi$ is deterministic (the same action is chosen every time), the value of the state is the same as the value of that action (same expected return).
If the policy $\pi$ is stochastic (actions are chosen with different probabilities), the value of the state is the weighted average (i.e. expectation) of the value of the actions.

➡️ If the Q-values are known, the V-values can be found easily.


We can note that the return at time $t$ depends on the **immediate reward** $r_{t+1}$ and the return at the next time step $t+1$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    R_t &= r_{t+1} + \gamma \, r_{t+2} +  \gamma^2  \, r_{t+3} + \dots + \gamma^k \, r_{t+k+1} + \dots \\
        &= r_{t+1} + \gamma \, ( r_{t+2} +  \gamma \, r_{t+3} + \dots + \gamma^{k-1} \, r_{t+k+1} + \dots) \\
        &= r_{t+1} + \gamma \,  R_{t+1} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

When taking the mathematical expectation of that identity, we obtain:

$$
    \mathbb{E}_{\rho_\pi}[R_t] = r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) + \gamma \, \mathbb{E}_{\rho_\pi}[R_{t+1}]
$$

It becomes clear that the value of an action depends on the immediate reward received just after the action, as well as the value of the next state:

$$
        Q^{\pi}(s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) + \gamma \,  V^{\pi} (s_{t+1})
$$

However, this is only for a fixed $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$ transition.
Taking transition probabilities into account, one can obtain the Q-values through the equation:

$$
    Q^{\pi}(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim p(s'|s, a)} [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{\pi} (s') ] = \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{\pi} (s') ]
$$


The value of an action depends on:

* the states $s'$ one can arrive after the action (with a probability $p(s' | s, a)$).
* the value of that state $V^{\pi} (s')$, weighted by $\gamma$ as it is one step in the future.
* the reward received immediately after taking that action $r(s, a, s')$ (as it is not included in the value of $s'$).


➡️ If the V-values are known, the Q-values can be found easily by a **1-step look-ahead**, i.e. looking at the achievable states.

### Bellman equations

Putting together those two equations, a fundamental property of value functions used throughout reinforcement learning is that they satisfy a particular recursive relationship:

$$
\begin{aligned}
        V^{\pi}(s)  &= \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(s, a) \, Q^{\pi} (s, a)\\
                    &= \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(s, a) \, \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{\pi} (s') ]
\end{aligned}
$$

This equation is called the **Bellman equation** for $V^{\pi}$.
It expresses the relationship between the value of a state $V^\pi(s)$ and the value of its successors $V^\pi(s')$, depending on the dynamics of the MDP ($p(s' | s, a)$ and $r(s, a, s')$) and the current policy $\pi$.
The interesting property of the Bellman equation for RL is that it admits one and only one solution $V^{\pi}(s)$.

The same recursive relationship stands for $Q^{\pi}(s, a)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
        Q^{\pi}(s, a)  &= \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{\pi} (s') ] \\
                    &=  \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, \sum_{a' \in \mathcal{A}(s')} \pi(s', a') \, Q^{\pi} (s', a')]
\end{aligned}
$$

which is called the **Bellman equation** for $Q^{\pi}$.

### Optimal Bellman equations

The optimal policy is the policy that gathers the maximum of reward on the long term.
Value functions define a partial ordering over policies:

::: {.callout-tip}
## Partial ordering
A policy $\pi$ is better than another policy $\pi'$ if its expected return is greater or equal than that of $\pi'$ for all states $s$.

$$
        \pi \geq \pi' \Leftrightarrow V^{\pi}(s) \geq V^{\pi'}(s) \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}
$$

:::


For a MDP, there exists at least one policy that is better than all the others: this is the **optimal policy** $\pi^*$.
We note $V^*(s)$ and $Q^*(s, a)$ the optimal value of the different states and actions under $\pi^*$.

$$
   V^* (s) = \max_{\pi} V^{\pi}(s) \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}
$$

$$
    Q^* (s, a) = \max_{\pi} Q^{\pi}(s, a) \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}
$$

When the policy is optimal $\pi^*$, the link between the V and Q values is even easier.
The V and Q values are maximal for the optimal policy: there is no better alternative.


The optimal action $a^*$ to perform in the state $s$ is the one with the highest optimal Q-value $Q^*(s, a)$.

$$
    a^* = \text{argmax}_a \, Q^*(s, a)
$$

By definition, this action will bring the maximal return when starting in $s$. The optimal policy is therefore **greedy** with respect to $Q^*(s, a)$, i.e. **deterministic**.

$$
    \pi^*(s, a) = \begin{cases}
                1 \; \text{if} \; a = a^* \\
                0 \; \text{otherwise.}
                \end{cases}
$$


As the optimal policy is deterministic, the optimal value of a state is equal to the value of the optimal action:

$$
    V^* (s)  = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} Q^{\pi^*} (s, a)
$$

The expected return after being in $s$ is the same as the expected return after being in $s$ and choosing the optimal action $a^*$, as this is the only action that can be taken.
This allows to define the **Bellman optimality equation** for $V^*$:

$$
    V^* (s)  = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}}  p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{*} (s') ]
$$

The same Bellman optimality equation stands for $Q^*$:

$$
    Q^* (s, a)  = \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [r(s, a, s')  + \gamma \max_{a' \in \mathcal{A}(s')} Q^* (s', a') ]
$$

The optimal value of $(s, a)$ depends on the optimal action in the next state $s'$.


<!--
# Bellman optimality equations


* The Bellman optimality equations for $V^*$ form a system of equations:

    * If there are $N$ states $s$, there are $N$ Bellman equations with $N$ unknowns $V^*(s)$.

$$
    V^* (s)  = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}}  p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{*} (s') ]
$$

* If the dynamics of the environment are known ($p(s' | s, a)$ and $r(s, a, s')$), then in principle one can solve this system of equations using linear algebra.

* For finite MDPs, the Bellman optimality equation for $V^*$ has a unique solution (one and only one).

    * This is the principle of **dynamic programming**.

* The same is true for the Bellman optimality equation for $Q^*$:

    * If there are $N$ states and $M$ actions available, there are $N\times M$ equations with $N\times M$ unknowns $Q^*(s, a)$.

$$
    Q^* (s, a)  = \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [r(s, a, s')  + \gamma \max_{a' \in \mathcal{A}(s')} Q^* (s', a') ]

    * for any state $s$, it can simply find the action that maximizes $Q^*(s,a)$.

* The action-value function effectively **caches** the results of all one-step-ahead searches into a single value: **model-free**.

* At the cost of representing a function of all state-action pairs, the optimal action-value function allows optimal actions to be selected without having to know anything about the environment's dynamics.

* But there are $N \times M$ equations to solve instead of just $N$... 

# How to solve the Bellman equations?

* Finding an optimal policy by solving the **Bellman optimality equations** requires the following:

    - accurate knowledge of environment dynamics $p(s' | s, a)$ and $r(s, a, s')$ for all transitions;

    - enough memory and time to do the computations;

    - the Markov property.

* How much space and time do we need? A solution requires an exhaustive search, looking ahead at all possibilities, computing their probabilities of occurrence and their desirability in terms of expected rewards.

* The number of states is often huge or astronomical (e.g., Go has about $10^{170}$ states).

* **Dynamic programming** solves exactly the Bellman equations.

* **Monte Carlo** and **temporal-difference** methods approximate them.

## Dynamic programming {#sec-dp}


![Generalized Policy Iteration. Source: @Sutton1998.](img/gpi-scheme.png){#fig-gpi width=40%}


In general, RL algorithms iterate over two steps:

1. **Policy evaluation**

    * For a given policy $\pi$, the value of all states $V^\pi(s)$ or all state-action pairs $Q^\pi(s, a)$ is calculated or estimated.

2. **Policy improvement**

    * From the current estimated values $V^\pi(s)$ or $Q^\pi(s, a)$, a new **better** policy $\pi$ is derived.


After enough iterations, the policy converges to the **optimal policy** (if the states are Markov).

This alternation between policy evaluation and policy improvement is called **generalized policy iteration** (GPI).
One particular form of GPI is **dynamic programming**, where the Bellman equations are used to evaluate a policy.

### Exact solution

Let's note $\mathcal{P}_{ss'}^\pi$ the transition probability between $s$ and $s'$ (dependent on the policy $\pi$) and $\mathcal{R}_{s}^\pi$ the expected reward in $s$ (also dependent):

$$
  \mathcal{P}_{ss'}^\pi = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(s, a) \, p(s' | s, a)
$$

$$
  \mathcal{R}_{s}^\pi = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(s, a) \, \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} \, p(s' | s, a) \ r(s, a, s')
$$


The Bellman equation becomes $V^{\pi} (s)  = \mathcal{R}_{s}^\pi + \gamma \, \displaystyle\sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} \, \mathcal{P}_{ss'}^\pi \, V^{\pi} (s')$.
As we have a fixed policy during the evaluation, the Bellman equation is simplified.

Let's now put the Bellman equations in a matrix-vector form.

$$
      V^{\pi} (s)  = \mathcal{R}_{s}^\pi + \gamma \, \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} \, \mathcal{P}_{ss'}^\pi \, V^{\pi} (s')
$$

We first define the vector of state values $\mathbf{V}^\pi$:

$$
  \mathbf{V}^\pi = \begin{bmatrix}
      V^\pi(s_1) \\ V^\pi(s_2) \\ \vdots \\ V^\pi(s_n) \\
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

and the vector of expected reward $\mathbf{R}^\pi$:

$$
  \mathbf{R}^\pi = \begin{bmatrix}
      \mathcal{R}^\pi(s_1) \\ \mathcal{R}^\pi(s_2) \\ \vdots \\ \mathcal{R}^\pi(s_n) \\
  \end{bmatrix}
$$


The state transition matrix $\mathcal{P}^\pi$ is defined as:

$$
  \mathcal{P}^\pi = \begin{bmatrix}
      \mathcal{P}_{s_1 s_1}^\pi & \mathcal{P}_{s_1 s_2}^\pi & \ldots & \mathcal{P}_{s_1 s_n}^\pi \\
      \mathcal{P}_{s_2 s_1}^\pi & \mathcal{P}_{s_2 s_2}^\pi & \ldots & \mathcal{P}_{s_2 s_n}^\pi \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
      \mathcal{P}_{s_n s_1}^\pi & \mathcal{P}_{s_n s_2}^\pi & \ldots & \mathcal{P}_{s_n s_n}^\pi \\
  \end{bmatrix}
$$


You can simply check that:

$$
  \begin{bmatrix}
      V^\pi(s_1) \\ V^\pi(s_2) \\ \vdots \\ V^\pi(s_n) \\
  \end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
      \mathcal{R}^\pi(s_1) \\ \mathcal{R}^\pi(s_2) \\ \vdots \\ \mathcal{R}^\pi(s_n) \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  + \gamma \, \begin{bmatrix}
      \mathcal{P}_{s_1 s_1}^\pi & \mathcal{P}_{s_1 s_2}^\pi & \ldots & \mathcal{P}_{s_1 s_n}^\pi \\
      \mathcal{P}_{s_2 s_1}^\pi & \mathcal{P}_{s_2 s_2}^\pi & \ldots & \mathcal{P}_{s_2 s_n}^\pi \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
      \mathcal{P}_{s_n s_1}^\pi & \mathcal{P}_{s_n s_2}^\pi & \ldots & \mathcal{P}_{s_n s_n}^\pi \\
  \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}
      V^\pi(s_1) \\ V^\pi(s_2) \\ \vdots \\ V^\pi(s_n) \\
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

leads to the same equations as:

$$
      V^{\pi} (s)  = \mathcal{R}_{s}^\pi + \gamma \, \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} \, \mathcal{P}_{ss'}^\pi \, V^{\pi} (s')
$$

for all states $s$.
The Bellman equations for all states $s$ can therefore be written with a matrix-vector notation as:

$$
  \mathbf{V}^\pi = \mathbf{R}^\pi + \gamma \, \mathcal{P}^\pi \, \mathbf{V}^\pi 
$$


If we know $\mathcal{P}^\pi$ and $\mathbf{R}^\pi$ (dynamics of the MDP for the policy $\pi$), we can simply obtain the state values:

$$
  (\mathbb{I} - \gamma \, \mathcal{P}^\pi ) \times \mathbf{V}^\pi = \mathbf{R}^\pi
$$

where $\mathbb{I}$ is the identity matrix, what gives:

$$
  \mathbf{V}^\pi = (\mathbb{I} - \gamma \, \mathcal{P}^\pi )^{-1} \times \mathbf{R}^\pi
$$

If we have $n$ states, the matrix $\mathcal{P}^\pi$ has $n^2$ elements.
Inverting $\mathbb{I} - \gamma \, \mathcal{P}^\pi$ requires at least $\mathcal{O}(n^{2.37})$ operations.
Forget it if you have more than a thousand states ($1000^{2.37} \approx 13$ million operations).
In dynamic programming, we will use iterative methods to estimate $\mathbf{V}^\pi$.

### Policy iteration

The idea of **iterative policy evaluation** (IPE) is to consider a sequence of consecutive state-value functions which should converge from initially wrong estimates $V_0(s)$ towards the real state-value function $V^{\pi}(s)$.

$$
      V_0 \rightarrow V_1 \rightarrow V_2 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow V_k \rightarrow V_{k+1} \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow V^\pi
$$



![Iterative policy estimaiton. Source: David Silver. <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html>](img/iterativepolicyevaluation2.png){width=80%}

The value function at step $k+1$ $V_{k+1}(s)$ is computed using the previous estimates $V_{k}(s)$ and the Bellman equation transformed into an **update rule**.

$$
  \mathbf{V}_{k+1} = \mathbf{R}^\pi + \gamma \, \mathcal{P}^\pi \, \mathbf{V}_k
$$

$V_\infty = V^{\pi}$ is a fixed point of this update rule because of the uniqueness of the solution to the Bellman equation.

## Iterative policy evaluation

* For a fixed policy $\pi$, initialize $V(s)=0 \; \forall s \in \mathcal{S}$.

* **while** not converged:

    * **for** all states $s$:

        * $V_\text{target}(s) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(s, a) \, \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V (s') ]$  

    * $\delta =0$

    * **for** all states $s$:

        * $\delta = \max(\delta, |V(s) - V_\text{target}(s)|)$

        * $V(s) = V_\text{target}(s)$

    * **if** $\delta < \delta_\text{threshold}$:

        * converged = True
:::


For each state $s$, we would like to know if we should deterministically choose an action $a \neq \pi(s)$ or not in order to improve the policy.
The value of an action $a$ in the state $s$ for the policy $\pi$ is given by:

$$
     Q^{\pi} (s, a) = \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{\pi}(s') ]
$$


If the Q-value of an action $a$ is higher than the one currently selected by the **deterministic** policy:

$$Q^{\pi} (s, a) > Q^{\pi} (s, \pi(s)) = V^{\pi}(s)$$

then it is better to select $a$ once in $s$ and thereafter follow $\pi$. If there is no better action, we keep the previous policy for this state. This corresponds to a **greedy** action selection over the Q-values, defining a **deterministic** policy $\pi(s)$:


$$\pi(s) \leftarrow \text{argmax}_a \, Q^{\pi} (s, a) = \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{\pi}(s') ]$$

After the policy improvement, the Q-value of each deterministic action $\pi(s)$ has increased or stayed the same.

$$\text{argmax}_a \; Q^{\pi} (s, a) = \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{\pi}(s') ] \geq Q^\pi(s, \pi(s))$$

This defines an improved policy $\pi'$, where all states and actions have a higher value than previously.
**Greedy action selection** over the state value function implements policy improvement:

$$\pi' \leftarrow \text{Greedy}(V^\pi)$$

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Greedy policy improvement:

* **for** each state $s \in \mathcal{S}$:

    * $\pi(s) \leftarrow \text{argmax}_a \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{\pi}(s') ]$

:::

Once a policy $\pi$ has been improved using $V^{\pi}$ to yield a better policy $\pi'$, we can then compute $V^{\pi'}$ and improve it again to yield an even better policy $\pi''$.
The algorithm **policy iteration** successively uses **policy evaluation** and **policy improvement** to find the optimal policy.

$$
  \pi_0 \xrightarrow[]{E} V^{\pi_0} \xrightarrow[]{I} \pi_1 \xrightarrow[]{E} V^{\pi^1} \xrightarrow[]{I}  ... \xrightarrow[]{I} \pi^* \xrightarrow[]{E} V^{*}
$$


The **optimal policy** being deterministic, policy improvement can be greedy over the state-action values.
If the policy does not change after policy improvement, the optimal policy has been found.

* Initialize a deterministic policy $\pi(s)$ and set $V(s)=0 \; \forall s \in \mathcal{S}$.

        * **for** all states $s$:

            * $V_\text{target}(s) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(s, a) \, \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V (s') ]$  

        * **for** all states $s$:

            * $V(s) = V_\text{target}(s)$

    * **for** each state $s \in \mathcal{S}$: *# Policy improvement*

        * $\pi(s) \leftarrow \text{argmax}_a \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V^{\pi}(s') ]$

    * **if** $\pi$ has not changed: **break**
:::



### Value iteration

One drawback of **policy iteration** is that it uses a full policy evaluation, which can be computationally exhaustive as the convergence of $V_k$ is only at the limit and the number of states can be huge.
The idea of **value iteration** is to interleave policy evaluation and policy improvement, so that the policy is improved after EACH iteration of policy evaluation, not after complete convergence.

As policy improvement returns a deterministic greedy policy, updating of the value of a state is then simpler:

$$
  V_{k+1}(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} p(s' | s,a) [r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V_k(s') ]
$$

Note that this is equivalent to turning the **Bellman optimality equation** into an update rule.
Value iteration converges to $V^*$, faster than policy iteration, and should be stopped when the values do not change much anymore.

# Asynchronous dynamic programming


* Synchronous DP requires exhaustive sweeps of the entire state set (**synchronous backups**).

    * **while** not converged: 

        * **for** all states $s$:

            * $V_\text{target}(s) =  \max_a \,  \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V (s') ]$  

        * **for** all states $s$:

            * $V(s) = V_\text{target}(s)$

* Asynchronous DP updates instead each state independently and asynchronously (**in-place**):

    * **while** not converged: 

        * Pick a state $s$ randomly (or following a heuristic).
    
        * Update the value of this state.

        $$
          V(s) =  \max_a \,  \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V (s') ]
        $$

* We must still ensure that all states are visited, but their frequency and order is irrelevant.

<!--
# Asynchronous dynamic programming

* Is it possible to select the states to backup intelligently? 

* **Prioritized sweeping** selects in priority the states with the largest remaining **Bellman error**:

$$\delta = |\max_a \,  \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V (s') ] - V(s) |$$

* A large Bellman error means that the current estimate $V(s)$ is very different from the **target** $y$: 

$$y = \max_a \,  \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \, [ r(s, a, s') + \gamma \, V (s') ]$$

* States with a high Bellman error should be updated in priority. 

* If the Bellman error is small, this means that the current estimate $V(s)$ is already close to what it should be, there is no hurry in evaluating this state. 

* The main advantage is that the DP algorithm can be applied as the agent is actually experiencing its environment (no need for the dynamics of environment to be fully known). 
-->

### Summary

Policy-iteration and value-iteration consist of alternations between policy evaluation and policy improvement, and converge to the optimal policy.
This principle is called **Generalized Policy Iteration** (GPI).
Solving the **Bellman equations** requires the following:

* accurate knowledge of environment dynamics $p(s' | s, a)$ and $r(s, a, s')$ for all transitions;
* enough memory and time to do the computations;
* the Markov property.

Finding an optimal policy is polynomial in the number of states and actions: $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \, M)$ ($N$ is the number of states, $M$ the number of actions).
The number of states is often astronomical (e.g., Go has about $10^{170}$ states), often growing exponentially with the number of state variables (what Bellman called **"the curse of dimensionality"**). In practice, classical DP can only be applied to problems with a few millions of states.
